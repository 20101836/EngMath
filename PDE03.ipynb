    "is probably the most important operator in mathematical physics. The question is, what does it mean and why should the sum of three second derivatives have anything to do with the laws of nature? The answer to this lies in the fact that the Laplacian of a function allows us to compare the function at a point with the function at neighboring points. It does what the second derivative did in one dimension and might be thought of as a second derivative generalized to higher dimensions\n",
